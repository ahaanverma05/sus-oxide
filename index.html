    <p style="font-size: 30px; font-family:sans-serif;">You may/may not have heard about susoxide. It is a very dangerous virus that is very harmful and this is it's official webpage. Susoxide is bassicly a type of gas that contains "sus pullution". if you are infected by sus pullution, you will be teleported to a room in which you will have to choose ONE pill. If you choose the wrong one, your'e stuck as amogus forever. There is no cure yet. If you choose the right one, which only 10% of people who have ever had susoxide got the correct one, you will automaticly eject the virus out of your body. You will still have a huge risk of being infected by it again. Stay indoors, and do not use any Air Conditioner. Instead use a fan. Thats it for susoxide, but its pretty bad. As mentioned before, STAY INDOORS.</p>
